This python code takes as input BNF grammar rules, a list of words, and how many sentences you want to generate. It then 
generates that number of sentences made up of the given possible words and conforming to the given rules of the 
BNF grammar.
my_gen.py works only when it is given command-line arguments
specifically:
python my_gen.py grammar_file number_of_sentences output_file
